      <h1>1. Web development</h1>
      <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development
        can
        range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
        businesses, and social network services.</p>

      <h1>2. HTML</h1>
      <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript. </p>

      <h1>3. CSS</h1>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in
        a
        markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.</p>

      <h1>4. Python</h1>
      <p>
        This is a high-level and general-purpose language that focuses on code readability. It's one of the most popular
        beginner languages because of its ease of use, wide application, active community, and freedom of use.
        Programmers
        can use it for object-oriented, structured, or functional tasks. Python has a comprehensive standard library,
        which has earned the language the title "batteries included." The libraries provide tools for many tasks, such
        asThis is the world's most popular programming language. Coders mainly use it on the world wide web to create
        web
        interfaces or websites. It can be an easy-to-learn language. Programmers may classify JavaScript as a high-level
        language, multi-paradigm, and just in time compiled. It features dynamic typing, first-class functions, and
        prototype-based object orientation. JavaScript can be a significant enabler of website interactivity and
        richness.
        While HTML builds the foundation for websites, JavaScript drives the websites. JavaScript has a famous library
        called JQuery used by most websites.
        creating internet applications, graphical user interfaces, and data analytics.

      <h1>5. Java</h1>
      <p>Developers mostly use Java for web apps' back-end interfaces or general service application programming
        interfaces (APIs) enhanced by frameworks such as Spring and Dropwizard. Java differs from JavaScript in that
        it's
        a strongly typed language, translating to a deeper learning curve. The complexity is an advantage that makes
        Java
        have higher performance. Java enforces its performance by multi-thread work that can run concurrently.
        JavaScript
        only uses a single thread. Java also balances complexity and performance by avoiding many items that the coder
        can
        manage in other languages.</p>

      <h1>7. C and C++</h1>
      <p>
        C is a low-level language. This means that it requires the programmer to understand the underlying computer
        hardware. High-level languages have abstracted the computer details. For example, when using a low-level
        language,
        your program can take care of memory management in the code. Typically, higher programming languages automate
        the
        process of memory management for computers. Although C is low level, it compensates for having better
        performance
        than other easy-to-learn languages. While performance might not be a significant concern for a social media app,
        it's a substantial consideration for gaming apps, movie special effects software, and portions of operating
        systems.

      <h1>8. SQL</h1>
      <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query data. Computers send the SQL data queries to a server that
        responds with the requested data. SQL allows you to retrieve, insert, update, delete, and create data within a
        database. There are many variants of SQL and all variants have several similarities. The ANSI standard
        requirement
        enforces these similarities that the variants include significant commands, such as where, select, and delete.

      <h1>9. Ruby</h1>
      <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming
        paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is
        an
        object, including primitive data types.</p>
